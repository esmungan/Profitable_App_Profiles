# Profitable_App_Profiles

This project is done as a part of Python for Data Science: Fundamentals class on DataQuest. 

  - Concepts learned: Phyton syntax and fundamental data structures, exposed to Jupiter Notebooks, Github and Kaggle
  - Main challenges: Cleaning up two large datasets with different structures. Analyzing data for skewed or small datasets.

The aim of this project is to provide more insight for developers on what kinds of apps return better profits based on user data. 
The data to be looked at is for free and English-only apps in IOS and Android markets. The raw datasets are obtained from:

  - [Android](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home)
  - [IOS](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home)
